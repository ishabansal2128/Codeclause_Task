# Basic Text Editor Code

The provided Python code offers a simple implementation of a text editor using the Tkinter library, which enables the creation of graphical user interfaces. This text editor application consists of a class called "TextEditor." Within its constructor, it initializes the main application window and configures the text widget where users can input and edit text. The text widget is set to wrap words at the end of lines and dynamically expand as the window is resized.

The program includes a menu bar at the top of the window with two submenus: "File" and "Edit." The "File" menu provides options to create new files, open existing ones, save the current content, and exit the application. The "Edit" menu includes options for cutting, copying, and pasting text within the text widget.

Functionalities such as opening, saving, and editing files are achieved through methods associated with the corresponding menu options. The "Cut," "Copy," and "Paste" functionalities are implemented using the event_generate function to interact with the text widget's built-in actions.

To use the text editor, the script initializes the Tkinter application window, creates an instance of the TextEditor class, and starts the main event loop. Although this implementation is straightforward, it provides a foundation that can be expanded upon to create more advanced text editors with additional features and customized behaviors.
